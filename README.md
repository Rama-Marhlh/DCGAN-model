# DCGAN-model
Our idea ?
We aim to merge human artistry with AI innovation by regenerating images born from a collaboration between artists and artificial intelligence. ​  Our goal is to create a distinctive collection of images that reflect the fusion of human creativity and machine-generated art. ​  ​

Our data ?
Data sets are human-made arts and artificial intelligence arts. We searched for ready-made data sets, but we did not get what we wanted, so we collected the data ourselves in order to obtain acceptable results. The number of the  real-images dataset was 12206 image , and the AI-generated images was 8334 image .
